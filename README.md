# Tufts SIGGRAPH webgpu-learnalong

Let's learn modern graphics together!

### What is WebGPU?

WebGPU is an exciting new graphics API that is now available in most browsers! It is designed to replace WebGL and bring lower level controls and a more intuitive programming style.

### What is this learn-along?

This is a chance for us to learn a technology together and from each other. This way we can each figure out our own little parts and then teach each other what we've learned and what mistakes to avoid.

Ultimately we will probably try making some cool demo at the end

### What are we going to learn?

Some of these you may know, but this is all the content this learn along will likely cover.

- Render Pipeline Model
- Compute Shaders
- Working with textures, reading and writing
- Ray-tracing and ray-marching
- Camera matrices and coordinate transforms

### Project Ideas

In the end we hope to make some sort of demo, here are some ideas we might make, feel free to add any!

- Interactive water with caustics, (similar to Evan Wallace's [WebGL Water Demo](https://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/))
   - I would love a landing page on my personal website to be of a pool of water with reflections and soft rippling, and then hovering over menu items causes a ripple.
   - If we collaborated, any or all of us use it.

### Learning Goals

Hopefully we will implement all of the following in minimal viable examples, feel free to add any you want to cover!

- [ ] Hello Triangle
- [x] Google's Game of Life GPU Simulation tutorial
- [ ] Interactive ripple Texture
- [ ] Rendering a finite sine wave plane \w movable camera
- [ ] Add Fresnel sky reflection and water base color to sine wave plane
- [ ] Add bloom sun-spots to sine wave plane (might not work)
- [ ] Add ray traced refractive texture lookup to water base color
- [ ] Add caustics to refractive lookup
- [ ] Add interactive ripple texture
